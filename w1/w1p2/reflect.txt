The topics I learned by completing this workshop are parsing formatted text files, connecting modules through 'includes', and sorting arrays through the bubbling method - but by far the most challenging area of the workshop was understanding the prewritten formula of finding the title barLength. To understand it better, I had to calculate values and navigate the modules as they pass these values as parameters. I would then concatenate these calculations to better understand the logic behind the formulation. This skill would probably be useful for joining a team of developers, as others' code may not always be intelligible, clear, or have detailed comments describing the process.
